jQuery 2
===

This package is published to NPM as an alias for the latest current version of jQuery 2.x, and will always install with the most recent version of jQuery 2.x as its export.

This package exists purely to make it possible to install both jQuery 1 and 2 via NPM.

I make no claim of ownership or affiliation with the jQuery project or the jQuery Foundation.  If anyone involved with jQuery wishes to take over or replace this package, please contact me at chiper@chipersoft.com
